In order to advance further, The computer needs to be functioning and booting. 
  
  There were one issue preventing computer from booting and one issue preventing addition of storage.

  Issue --> Critical --> Sytem boot
        1. The cpu would shut down.
           Issues: Issue displayed | Presented in Bios | "System temperature (90D)"
       Resolution: High Temperature| Either Fan or CPU issues
          Method : FAN issues | Open the case --> Start the computer --> Check if the fan is spinning --> If it is, no action is needed; if not, replace the fan.
                   CPU isses  | Open the case --> access the motherboard --> clean the dust off fan --> clean the dust off the radiator --> clean the heatsink with isopropyl 
                                apply new thermal paste.
    My soultion : CPU issues | I replaced the thermal paste.
       Solution : Issue must be mitigated.
  
    Issue --> Moderate --> Optical to SSD replacment issue
        2. Issue : After replacing the CD/DVD drive with a 2.5" SSD in a caddy, the system failed to boot.
   Error messages: BIOS: "Check media cable" | System: "Remove disk and other media" | Symptoms: New SSD not detected in BIOS, even though the drive worked with old SSD.
      Resoultion : Motherboard | SSD | SATA | Power issue 
          Method : Motherboard issue | Enter BIOS → Check storage controller settings → Confirm set to AHCI mode → Update BIOS if outdated.
                           SSD issue | Connect SSD externally via USB → If recognized, SSD is fine → If not, SSD may be faulty.
                          SATA issue | Open case → Ensure SSD is seated properly in the caddy → Inspect caddy for damage/incompatibility → Test with another SATA port if available.
                         Power issue | Verify caddy provides sufficient power → Test with a different caddy model (some low-quality caddies do not supply stable power to SSDs).
                Alternative solution | If internal replacement fails, use a USB-to-SATA adapter to run the SSD as an external drive.
    My  Soultion : Instead of continuing with the internal caddy setup, I used a USB-to-SATA adapter to connect the SSD externally. Look at section 3 for details
 Additional step :Took the laptop to a repair shop → They confirmed the SSD itself was fine but could not get it working internally via caddy.
                  searched for answers on Reddit and forums → No confirmed solution for this specific model.
        Solution : Issue was avoided and replaced.


                                                        The computer is booting with extra storage.

        Downloading operating system. (another computer needed)
        1. Pick your OS and download the iso.
              --> I used TrunNas 
                  Download TrueNas [here](https://www.truenas.com/)
        2. Method of booting drive
              --> USB drive (atleast 8 GB)
        3. USB drive by itself wont boot.
            1. Download rufus (https://rufus.ie/en/)
            2. Select the downloded iso as a source --> pick your usb drive --> select GPT or MBR.
                a. GPT is normally for newer computer MBR is for legacy Bios.
                b. How to check GPT or MBR
                    Windows | access cmd as admin --> type the following --> diskpart | list disk --> if there is a "*" its GPT, if black its MBR
                c. Start it and let rufus do the rest.
        4. Plug the USB drive into the computer with replaced drive and enter bios and boot from USB.
                                                
                                              Os is installed.

External SSD instalation
  1. Connect the SSD
      Slide your SSD into the SATA connector on the adapter or enclosure.
      If you’re using an enclosure, secure it in place (some use screws, others just snap shut).
      Plug the USB cable into your computer.
  2. Initialize the SSD (First-Time Setup)
      A brand-new SSD won’t show up in File Explorer until you initialize it. Here’s how:
        a. press Win + R, type diskmgmt.msc, and hit Enter
        b. Look at Initalize disk
             1. If the disk does not show up
                Reboot your PC. |Check the physical connection: make sure the data and power cables are firmly plugged in.| Try a different SATA port or cable if available. | If it’s an external drive, check the USB port or use another cable.
        c.Select GPT (GUID Partition Table) for modern systems (Windows 10/11).
            Choose MBR (Master Boot Record) only if you need it for older PCs.
            Click OK to continue.
  3. Create a Partition & Format the Drive
      a. In Disk Management, find your SSD (it’ll show as Unallocated).
      b. Right-click the unallocated space → choose New Simple Volume.
      c. Go through the setup wizard:
          Volume Size: Leave it as default to use the full drive.
          Drive Letter: Pick one (e.g., E:).
          File System: Select NTFS (best for Windows). Use exFAT if you also want it to work on macOS/Linux.
          Allocation Size: Keep as Default.
          Volume Label: Give it a name (like ExternalSSD).
      d. Click Finish → Windows will format the drive.

  4. Check the SSD
      Open File Explorer, go to This PC, and you should see your SSD with the new drive letter.
      Right-click → Properties if you want to double-check capacity and file system.
  

                      SSD is formatted and Installed
