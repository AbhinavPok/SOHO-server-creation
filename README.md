# Home Server: NAS + Security System

This project demonstrates how I converted an old laptop into a fully functional server that acts as:
- **NAS (Network Attached Storage)** for centralized file storage and backup
- **Home Security System** with camera integration and monitoring

The goal is to repurpose old hardware into a **low-cost, efficient, and secure server**, while documenting setup steps, configurations, and security best practices.
