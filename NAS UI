Log into NAS.
  Username is typically root or truenas_admin
  password is the one you created before.
XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX
Once logged on
  There are list of tabs typically on the lefthand side
    Dashboard or the home screen : It shows the activities and the system usages. It is important to closely monitor the dashboard because it provides critical indicators if potential issues begin to develop.
                         Storage : It provides an overview of the detected disks, configured storage pools,encryption and current RAID configuration.
                          Shares : It give you the platfrom to share files with another devices by creating a network folder.
                 Data Protection : It gives you the platfrom to backup datas.This is important because it helps protect integrity and availability, but not confidentiality, which is handled under the Storage section.
                         Network : It gives you the platform to troubleshoot or modify your network settings such as VLANS, DNS , IPS and Ethernet
                     Credentials : It gives you the platform to implement least priveledge principle by controlling access of certian files based on permissions.
                 Virtualizations : It gives you the platform to virtulaized your NAS.
                            Apps : It give you the platform to install apps directly to NAS, such as
                                    () Nextcloud for file share 
                                    () Dockers and Kubernetes
                                    () Plex for media managment and many more.
                        Reporting : It is similar to log files in desktop and servers, it show both current and previous system usage and activites. The cuurrent usages is shown in desktop from here.
                  System Settings : It gives you platform to make changes, accessibility settings, services management(some of these can be found in networks aswell), and most imporatantly the UPDATES.

Creating a drive and shares
  Once logged on you must create a pool, to configure the disks.
      Pool can be created in STORAGE -> Pool Manager -> Create a name for the drive.
      This is also where you can implement your raid solutions.
            Stripe : Similar to RAID 0. This is for speed only, if one drive fails, data is lost
            Mirror : Similar to RAID 1. This the for mirror and speed. Two drives = 1 big drive. They are essentially duplicates of each other.
            RaidZ1 : Similar to RAID 5. This the Stripe + Parity. This requires atleast three drives, where on is parity (safe checksum) to prevent data lost if one of the drives fails.
            RaidZ2 : This is similar to RAID 5, where instead of 1 parity there is two parity drives. It is used in very imporant large datasets.
      Create a user
          User can be created in Credentials -> Add users
              You can create Root users, User ID or groups , Directory and permissions.
      Share it to the network.
            Once users are created, navigate to Shares -> (SMB for Windows, NFS for Unix, iSCSI for sharing virtual drives over networks)
            Set the path for the user, then start the service.
      Make it accessable to user depending on thier permissions.
            Storage -> edit ACL -> Permission Types.
      NAS is up and running.
