  1. For this project, it’s best to use a computer that is reliable, has enough space to store files and videos, and can run all day without issues. 
  2. It should be able to handle both storing your data and running the security system at the same time. The computer should also give you room to add more storage in the future if needed. 
  3. Overall, the focus should be on dependability, storage space, and the ability to grow with your needs.

  Whats recommended
  CPU = Quad core I5 or Higher / Ryzen 5 or Higher 
  Memory = 8 gigs or higher/ DDR4 or Higher
  Storage = 1 TB or Higher 
  Network Interface = CAT 5e or Higher (1Gbps)
  GPU = Not requried (Intergetraed GPU), optimal if there is a GPU
  Power = UPS/ Redundant powersupply if possible.
  Documentation = Pick your documnetation. Logical and Physical recommended.

  What I Have (NEVER A GOOD PRACTICE TO POST YOUR HARDWARE SPECS ONLINE)
  CPU = Intel i5-3320M CPU
  Memory = 8 Gigs
  Network Interface = Intel(R) 82579LM Gigabit Network Connection
  Storage = 117 usable gigs 
  GPU = Intel® HD Graphics 4000
  Power = Broken power supply.
  Documentation = Cisco packet tracer

  Although CPU, RAM, Network Interface and GPU would be sufficiant will be enough, There will be the need for more storage,stability, and maintaince
  

  1. The two most important thing is storage and functioning computer.
      a. Storage can be done by replacing the orginal drive and replacing the optical media for another drive.
          - In this laptop, there is a latch behind the computer that will pop out once pulled.
          - There is three screws holding the internal drive.
          - You can click on the optical media on side of computer and gentely pull it out.
          -  While I had acess to motherboard, I cleaned it free of dust.
      b. Issues found
          - CPU overheating 
          - Optical drive not working
